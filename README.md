# pilespacechecker
This script imports a spreadsheet of a building's piled foundation coordinates from a Building Information Model and checks the spacing between all the piles to quickly detect horizontal distance between the centers. This allows us to quickly ensure that minimum clearance is fulfilled and non-compliances are picked up early.
