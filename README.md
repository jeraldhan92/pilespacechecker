# Description
This script imports a spreadsheet of a building's piled foundation coordinates from a Building Information Model and checks the centre-to-centre distances between all the piles. This allows us to quickly ensure that minimum clearance is fulfilled and non-compliances are picked up early. The minimum clearance required is usually between 2.5 to 3 times the average diameter of the two piles being checked. As it is quite common for a building to have more than a hundred piles, relying on the manual checking processes often result in non-compliances. The later these are discovered, the more costly it is to re-engineer the structure.
